# Introduction

The dataset used for this analysis contains information on [alternative fuel stations](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-03-01/readme.md) from the [R for Data Science's Tidy Tuesday Github page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). The original source of the data is the [US Department of Energy](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download/alt_fuel_stations_format). The goal for this analysis is to better understand which alternative fuel stations are most prominent, how they're distributed accross the US, and what relationships exist between state populations and the number of stations in each state.

### Alternative Fuel Station Data

The main features from the [alternative fuel stations data](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download/alt_fuel_stations_format) that this analysis will focus on are the following:

+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name       | Description                                                                                                |
+============+============================================================================================================+

|            | | LPG   | Propane (LPG)                |                                                                   |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

### Population Data

The main features from the [2020 Census data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/density-data-text.html) that this analysis will focus on are the following:

+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name               | Description                                                        |
+====================+====================================================================+
| Population         | Resident population estimates                                      |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Population density | Resident population densities for each state (residents / sq. mi.) |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

## TODO: Another entry for the other census data

# Data Wrangling

### Load Libraries

For this analysis we'll make use of the `tidytuesdayR` package to load the Tidy Tuesday dataset; the `tidyverse` ecosystem for data tidying, manipulation, exploration, and visualization; `ggpubr` for displaying correlations on plots; `lubridate` for handling datetimes; `tidymodels` for building a regression model; and `kntr` for creating tables.

```{r load-libraries}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidymodels)
library(knitr)
library(gganimate)
theme_set(theme_light())
```

### Import Data

The 03/01/2022 Tidy Tuesday data is loaded in using the tidytuesdayR package, along with the Census data. We can also create a state reference dataframe to help with merging tables where one has the state abbreviation and the other has the state's full name. The state area can also be added to later calculate station densities.

```{r import-data}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-03-01')
stations_raw <- tuesdata$stations

# https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html
# Census data 2010 - 2019
pop_raw <- read_csv("https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/national/totals/nst-est2019-alldata.csv")
#https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/density-data-text.html
# census data 1910 - 2020 (every 10 years)
pop_raw_2020 <- read_csv("https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/apportionment/apportionment.csv")

# create state abbrevation/name ref table
states_ref <- tibble(
    name = state.name,
    abbr = state.abb,
    area = state.area
)
```


## Clean Data

Our main set of Census data is cleaned by removed non-state values, reshaping the dataframe so each year is in a single column, joining with the `state_ref` dataframe to get the state land area and finally calculating the population densities. The other set of Census data we'll be using to get values for 2020, is filtered and joined to our main Census data.

```{r clean-pop-density-data}
 pop_density_2020 <- pop_raw_2020 |> 
    # only look at the year 2020 and state data
    filter(Year == 2020, `Geography Type` == "State") |> 
    # rename and select releveant columns
    transmute(state = Name, year = as.character(Year), pop_den = `Resident Population Density`, pop=`Resident Population`) |> 
    # join with the states_ref data to get the state abbreviations
    inner_join(states_ref, by=c("state" = "name")) |> 
    select(state, year, pop)

pop_density <- pop_raw |> 
  # remove non state observation
  filter(STATE != "00") |> 
  # gather the pop estimate column headers into a single column for 
  # year and the values into a new pop column
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("POPESTIMATE"),names_to = "year", values_to = "pop") |> 
  # downselect the columns
  transmute(state = NAME, year, pop) |> 
  # separate the year from the popestimate text 
  separate(col=year, sep = "POPESTIMATE", into=c(NA, "year")) |> 
  # add 2020 data
  bind_rows(pop_density_2020) |> 
  # join with the state area data
  inner_join(states_ref, by=c("state" = "name")) |> 
  # calcualte the population density
  mutate(pop_den = pop / area, year = as.numeric(year)) |> 
  # select the columns of interest
  select(state, abbr, year, pop_den, area)
```

The `stations_raw` data is cleaned by changing the categorical data to factors and changing the `OPEN_DATE` variable from a string to a date. The latitude/longitudes are also filtered to restrict the data to only that found in the US. The data is then joined with the census data. 

Since much of this analysis refers to population data and we do not have population densities after the year 2020 available, we will drop any station data for years where we do not have population density data (before 2010, after 2020). 

```{r clean-station-data}
stations <- stations_raw |> 
    # rename columns, convert to factors and dates
    transmute(
      state = factor(STATE), 
      city = factor(CITY), 
      lat = LATITUDE, 
      lon = LONGITUDE, 
      fuel_type = factor(FUEL_TYPE_CODE),
      open_date = ymd_hms(OPEN_DATE),
      open_year = as.numeric(year(OPEN_DATE))
      ) |> 
    # filter by lat/lon for continental US
    filter(lat > 24 & lat < 52, lon < -64 & lon > -126) |> 
    # join with the population data
    inner_join(pop_density, by=c("state" = "abbr", "open_year" = "year")) |> 
    # rename the state columns
    rename(abbr = state, state = state.y) |> 
    # move the state column to the front
    relocate(state, .before = everything())
```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

### How are Fuel Stations Distributed Across the US

We can create a histogram of stations by their latitude to get a one dimensional view of how they are distributed from south to north. The histograms can be separated based on fuel type to see how the distributions for each vary. Note that the y-axis is varies by histogram, so the bar heights themselves are not comparable between plots.

```{r}
stations |> 
    
    ggplot(aes(lat)) +
    geom_histogram(bins=15) + 
    facet_wrap(vars(fuel_type), scales="free_y") + 
    labs(
      x="Latitude", 
      y="Electric Stations", 
      title="Distribution of Electric Stations by Latitude"
      )
```

We can see from the histograms that electric, hydrogen, Liquified Natural Gas, and Propane are mostly used in the middle latitudes. This may be a result of a large number of cities such as Baltimore, Washington D.C. Philadelphia, Denver, and San Franscio being located in the central latitudes.

Ethanol's distribution is left scewed, showing that more stations are used in the northern latitudes than the southern latitudes.

We can do the same for longitudes to better understand the distribution of fuel stations from west to east.

```{r}
stations |> 
    ggplot(aes(lon)) +
    geom_histogram(bins=15) + 
    facet_wrap(vars(fuel_type), scales="free_y") + 
    labs(
      x="Longitude", 
      y="Stations", 
      title="Distribution of Stations by Longitude"
      )
```

Looking at the longitude distributions, we can see that more electric fuel stations are located in the west and east coasts than in the middle of the country. Ethanol and Propane however are more prominent in the middle of the country than closer to the coasts.

To better visualize teh overall distribution, we can create a new map showing the locations of each fuel station. To reduce clutter, we can plot each fuel type separately and color by state.

```{r}
stations |> 
    ggplot(aes(lon, lat, color=state)) +
    borders("state") + 
    geom_point(size=0.1, alpha=.4, show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_map() +
    theme_void() +
    facet_wrap(vars(fuel_type)) + 
    labs(title="Locations of Each Station Fuel Type")
```

From looking at the maps, electric fuel stations seem to vastly outnumber all other fuel stations, with Hydrogen looking to be the least utilized. Biodiesel looks to be very prominent in North Carolina and South Carolina, filling most of the states, as well as the southern part of Minnesota. Ethanol looks to be most prominently used in the Great Lakes and part of the Mid-West.

Because electric fuel stations are the most most prominent type, we can take a more detailed look at that map.

```{r}
stations |> 
    filter(fuel_type == "ELEC") |> 
    ggplot(aes(lon, lat, color=state)) +
    borders("state") + 
    geom_point(size=.1, alpha=.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_map() +
    theme_void() + 
    labs(title="Locations for all Electric Stations")
```

Adding animation to the map allows us to view how the distributions of electric fueling stations changed as more were added over time. It appears from the animation that there was an explosion of electric station starting in the years 2011-2012 which is likely due to the fact that the first mass produced electric vehicles, the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt, were released in December 2010.

```{r}
stations |> 
    filter(fuel_type == "ELEC", !is.na(open_year)) |> 
    ggplot(aes(lon, lat, color=state)) +
    borders("state") + 
    geom_point(aes(group = seq_along(open_year)), size=.1, show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_map() +
    theme_void() + 
    labs(title="Electric Fueling Stations", 
         subtitle="Year: {round(frame_along)}") + 
    transition_reveal(open_year)
```

## Fuel Types

We can get a clearer picture of how many more electric fuel stations there are than any other kind with a bar chart.

```{r plot-fuel-types}
stations |> 
    group_by(fuel_type) |> 
    summarize(n = n()) |> 
    mutate(fuel_type = fct_reorder(fuel_type, n)) |> 
    ggplot(aes(fuel_type, n)) + 
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, fill="darkblue") + 
    coord_flip() +
    labs(
      x="", 
      y="Total Stations", 
      title="Total Number of Stations for Each Fuel Type"
      )
```

It's clear from the plot above that electric fuel stations vastly outnumber every other fuel station combined. Because electric stations make up the vast majority of stations, we will reduce our scope to only those by filtering our data to only contain electric fueling stations.

```{r}
station_elec <- stations |> 
    filter(fuel_type == "ELEC")
```

Focusing on electric fuel stations, we can look at which cities have the most stations.

```{r plot-elec-cities}
station_elec |> 
    # count the stations in each city, state
    count(state, city) |> 
    # order from most to least
    arrange(desc(n)) |> 
    # get the top 20 cities with the most stations
    head(20) |> 
    # reorder the factors based on the most stations
    mutate(city = fct_reorder(city, n)) |> 
    ggplot(aes(city, n, fill=state)) +
    geom_col() + 
    coord_flip() + 
    labs(
      x="", 
      y="Total Electric Stations", 
      title="Total Electric Stations by City", 
      fill="State"
      )
```

The city of Los Angeles has the most electric fuel stations and about twice as much as the San Diego which has the second highest number of stations. 9 out of the 20 cities with the highest number of electric fuel stations are in California, indicating that California may contain more stations than any other state.

We can confirm this by now plotting the states with the highest number of stations.

```{r plot-elec-states}
station_elec |> 
    # count the number of stations in each state
    count(state) |>  
    # reorder the factors based on number of stations
    mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, n)) |> 
    ggplot(aes(state, n)) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, fill="darkblue") + 
    coord_flip() + 
    labs(
      x="", 
      y="Total Number of Stations", 
      title="Total Number of Electric Stations by State"
      )
```

Based on the plot above, California clearly leads the country in number of electric fueling stations. How do they compare when taking into account the size of the state?

By dividing the total number of stations each state has by the area of the state we can get a "station density" for each state to get a clearer picture of how many stations each state has, taking into account the size of the state. For example, if a very large state such as Texas has as many fueling stations as a smaller state like Massachusetts, then Massachusetts likely has better electric station coverage than Texas as the distance between stations is important for fueling during travel.

```{r}
pop_station_den <- station_elec |> 
  select(state, open_year) |> 
  inner_join(pop_density, by=c("open_year" = "year", "state")) |> 
  count(state, open_year, pop_den, area, name="num_stations") |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
  arrange(state, open_year) |> 
  mutate(tot_stations = cumsum(num_stations), station_density = tot_stations / area)  |> 
  select(state, open_year, pop_den, station_density) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  complete(state, open_year) |> 
  mutate(pop_den = replace_na(pop_den, 0), station_density = replace_na(station_density, 0))
```

We can plot the newly calcualted station densities:
```{r plot-elec-states-density}
pop_station_den |> 
    filter(open_year == 2020) |> 
    mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, station_density)) |> 
    ggplot(aes(state, station_density)) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, fill="darkblue") + 
    coord_flip() +
    labs(
      x="", 
      y="Electric Station Density (station / sq. mi.)", 
      title="Electric Station Density by State"
      )
```

# Model Building

### Regressing Station Density on Population Density

A sufficient number of fuel stations must be created to cover the size of the land area and the population of people that they are meant to serve. Given that fuel stations are being produced to meet the needs of their land area and populations, we can expect to see a positive correlation between the population density of a given state and the station density in that state.

```{r}
pop_station_den_2020 <- filter(pop_station_den, open_year==2020)

pop_station_den_2020 |> 
    ggplot(aes(pop_den, station_density)) +
    geom_point() + 
    # put both axes on log scale to transform exponential data to linear
    scale_x_log10() + 
    scale_y_log10() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) + 
    stat_cor() + 
    geom_text(aes(label=state), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1, hjust = 1) + 
    labs(
      y="Electric Station Density (station / sq. mi.)", 
      x = "Population Density (population / sq. mi.)" , 
      title="Do States with Higher Population Densities Have Higher Station Densities?"
      )
```
We can build the linear model to make inferences about the relationship. We'll use a log transform for both the predictor and response variables as we did above in the plot.
```{r}
# build a linear regression model regressing station density onto population density
lm_mod <- linear_reg() |> 
  fit(log10(station_density) ~ log10(pop_den), data=pop_station_den_2020)
# get the 95% confidence intervals
coef <- tidy(lm_mod, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level=0.95) |> 
  filter(term != "(Intercept)")
coef |> 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high) |> 
  cbind(glance(lm_mod)) |> 
  select(estimate, r.squared, statistic, conf.low, conf.high, p.value) |> 
  kable()
```

The linear regression model shows a strong correlation of 0.93 between the population density of a state and the station density of that state. With this correlation, we have an $R^2$ showing that our model explains about `r glance(lm_mod)$r.squared`% of the variability in the data. We also obtained a p-value of `r glance(lm_mod)$p.value`. This implies that under a null hypothesis that the linear model has a slope of 0, there is a near zero probability that we would find the calculated slope above from random samples of the data. This indicates that the relationship found between population density and station density is statistically significant.

Because we used a logarithmic transform for both the predictor and response variables, we **cannot** simply infer that for each 1 unit increase in the population density, we expect to see, on average, a `r coef$estimate` $\pm$ `r coef$estimate - coef$conf.low` increase in station density. Instead, taking the logarithmic transforms into account, we can infer from this model that for every 1% increase in the population density of a state, we can expect, on average, a `r coef$estimate`% $\pm$ `r coef$estimate - coef$conf.low`% increase in the station density for that state ([UVA Library StatLab](https://data.library.virginia.edu/interpreting-log-transformations-in-a-linear-model/)).

  scale_y_log10() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label=state), check_overlap = TRUE) + 
  transition_time(open_year) + 
  labs(

## Conclusion
